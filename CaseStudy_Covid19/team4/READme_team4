Here we explore transmission models in Stan, and it's a good learning opportunity for those interested in modelling covid 19 outbreak and making Bayesian inferences. 
With Bayesian inference, we quantify uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge into the model. 
In this repo,  we incorporate a susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model into stan, using data from the first two months of covid outbreak in British Columbia. We explore the benefits of mask-wearing as one of our parameters. 

This offers an amazing opportunity to understand mathematical models using Bayes for the parameters.

Summary 
The outbreak of COVID-19 is currently marking a significant turning point in British Columbia's public health. During the initial month of the pandemic, the province witnessed unprecedented challenges and responded rapidly to mitigate the spread of the virus. One critical aspect of managing the outbreak is ensuring timely testing and contact tracing availability. 

Obtaining accurate forecasting about the effect of certain methods, such as mask-wearing, becomes essential. This lay summary explores the significance of these initiatives and their role in managing the ongoing pandemic in the province. Using statistical and mathematical methods, researchers are currently estimating the impact of face masking on viral transmission.
Preliminary results indicate that the number of cases can decrease over time depending on the level of people mask-wearing with this measure.

In conclusion, wearing masks and accurate case forecasting is important in managing COVID-19 in British Columbia. These strategies highlight the importance of community engagement and data-driven decision-making in curbing the virus's spread and protecting public health. As the province continues to navigate the pandemic, maintaining vigilance and adherence to these practices will play a key role in the ongoing efforts to contain COVID-19.
